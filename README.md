It is Full-Stack Project that is Simple Search Engine which is basically used to search any particular website whole data ad content. 

In which I have made two sepaerate class which basically helped me to construct this whole project one is Web Crawler class in which I have applied Depth First Search Algorithm to find the data from particular website and after fetching all the data by web crawler it saves the data in the MYSQL Databases and we to access all the data we needed sepearte class and all handler to invoke data from databases and print it in formate of web apllications. For that i hav ebuilt search engine class and in that I have implemented servlet class and and all the required connection and styling to give some more shining to the web page. And it is hosted by the local Apache Host.

As sson as we make request is sent by frontend to backened and backened connects with web-servlets and based on that it fetches the data from the databses and after that it give responses back and we can get the results.

After compiling of search engine class successfully we are able to get the web page and in which i can search through any existing keyword  and based in that keyword we will get top 30 results and its happends on the basis of Ranking Algorithm that have been implemented in database logic.

To built these projects tech stack used like- Java, JavaServlets, HTML, CSS, JDBC, SQL etc.
