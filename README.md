It is Full-Stack Project that is Simple Search Engine which is basically used to search any particular website whole data ad content. 

In which I have made two sepaerate class which basically helped me to construct this whole project one is Web Crawler class in which I have applied Depth First Search Algorithm to find the data from particular website and after fetching all the data by web crawler it saves the data in the MYSQL Databases and we to access all the data we needed sepearte class and all handler to invoke data from databases and print it in formate of web apllications. For that i hav ebuilt search engine class and in that I have implemented servlet class and and all the required connection and styling to give some more shining to the web page. And it is hosted by the local Apache Host.

After comiling of search enine class successfully we are able to get the web page and in which i can search any keyword and we will get top 30 resukts based on that keyword and its happends on the basis of Ranking Algorithm I have implemented in project.

For all these things the kind of Tech stacks I have used like- Java, Core Java, HTML, CSS, JDBC, SQL etc.
